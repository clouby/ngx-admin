## Documentation (about Nebular - UI Kit)
This template is using [Nebular](https://github.com/akveo/nebular) modules set, [here you can find documentation and other useful articles](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/docs/guides/install-based-on-starter-kit).

### ng2-admin
We will continue supporting [ng2-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/tree/ng2-admin) version, but if you are starting from scratch we recommend using `ngx-admin`. Unfortunately, there is no way to automatically update from ng2-admin to ngx-admin, but some parts (Nebular components) could be manually included.

### Empty starter kit
Don't need all the pages and modules and just looking for an empty starter kit for your next project? Check out our [starter-kit branch](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/tree/starter-kit).

### AngularJS 1.x version
Here you can find AngularJS 1.x based version: [Blur Admin](http://akveo.github.io/blur-admin/)

## BrowserStack
This project runs its tests on multiple desktop and mobile browsers using [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com).
